This is a work very much in progress: a todo list written with Backbone.js.

A todo list seems like a simple enough thing to first attempt using Backbone with. It could also be a good opportunity for me to try out Flask and mondoDB or Redis.

Step 1. Make a locally stored list.
Step 2. Store data on a NoSQL DB and use Flask for an API.
Step 3. Profit?
